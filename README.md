# gRPC-Store

Objective
This project aims to automate the process after the creation of a delivery. Regardless of who creates the delivery, there is an API available that launches the process. The main goal is to ensure the delivery reaches its destination successfully, which involves managing resources like drivers and warehouses through BPMN workflows and Camunda.
